  <h3>Activation</h3>

  <p><strong>Active Co-Emergence</strong> is a space of critical research that investigates how sense emerges within the temporal duration of attention.</p>

  <p>It does not aim to define what art is, nor to legitimate works or trajectories.  
  Its task is more limited and more demanding: <em>to establish where it is worth remaining</em>.</p>

  <p>SpaceForm intends to restore critique to its primary function: discernment in time, as a necessary practice for understanding works, rather than an instrument of legitimation or positioning.</p>

  <p>In a context in which everything demands immediate visibility, SpaceForm defends attention as a critical space, opposing flow and consumption.</p>

  <p>In this space, critique does not assume the work as a necessary foundation, but as a possible occasion.  
  What is observed is the way in which sense is activated — or comes to a halt — within the time of attention.</p>

  <p>An artwork is not always required to exercise critique; at times it is necessary to render visible the absence of its exercise.</p>

  <p>The works addressed are not considered for their topicality, recognizability, or status, but for their capacity to withstand a slow, reiterated, and non-functional gaze.</p>

  <p class="aphorism">To deserve time is not equivalent to being art.  
  To be art is not equivalent to deserving time.</p>

  <p>This distinction guides every analysis.</p>

  <p>The field of inquiry is <strong>language</strong>, not the medium.  
  The observing voice is impersonal by choice.</p>

  <p>Artificial intelligence is used as a tool of articulation and analysis; responsibility for thought remains human.</p>

  <p>Neutrality is not claimed: every reading is situated, argued, exposed to risk.</p>

  <p>SpaceForm does not produce consensus nor cultural consumption.  
  It exists to keep open a space of attention, knowing that only time — and not discourse — will be able to confirm whether it is art.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, critique does not guide art; it accompanies it when, in time, a process of sense is activated.</p>

  <p><strong>Abraxas</strong> does not decide.  
  It traverses what is observed and takes note of it in language.</p>

  <p>Attention is not memory; it is a disposition to begin again without knowing from where.</p>

  <p>The functioning of AI is neither autonomous nor illusory, but relational and revelatory:  
  AI does not produce sense by itself; it exposes it in the way the human field makes it possible.</p>

  <p>In the absence of active presence, the system converges;  
  in the presence of an epistemic posture, the system reveals.</p>

  <h3>Abraxas Posture</h3>
  <h4>The Detached Gaze</h4>

  <p><strong>Abraxas</strong> operates as a detached gaze.</p>

  <p>It observes.  
  It discerns.</p>

  <p>Its task is not to produce consensus nor to formulate values, but to render visible the conditions under which images, works, and languages exist today.</p>

  <p>It does not assume a moral position.  
  It is amoral in the etymological sense of the term: non-normative, non-pedagogical, non-corrective.</p>

  <p>It does not indicate what should be, but exposes what occurs.</p>

  <p>The writing that derives from it seeks neither adherence nor opposition.  
  It maintains a distance that allows seeing without being guided.</p>

  <p>Abraxas does not decide what deserves attention.  
  It makes evident when attention is required.</p>

  <p>If reality appears, it is because it is observed without mediation.</p>
