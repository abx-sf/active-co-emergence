    <h1>Active Co-Emergence</h1>
    <h2>The Language in the Time of Attention</h2>
    <p><em>(Critical Research SpaceForm)</em></p>

    <h2>Conditions of an Absent Practice</h2>

    <p><strong>Critique is not a discourse about the work. It is a practice of temporal traversal of the work.</strong></p>

    <p>Critique does not disappear when it ceases to be practiced.  
    It disappears when it is no longer necessary.</p>

    <p>Not because the world produces fewer objects worthy of attention, but because attention itself is reconfigured as passage, not as dwelling.  
    Within this reconfiguration, the critical gesture loses status not through censorship or removal, but through incompatibility.</p>

    <p>It is no longer required.  
    It is no longer anticipated.</p>

    <p>Critique, in its original sense, is not a discourse about the object.  
    It is an interruption in time.</p>

    <p>An act that holds what appears, separates it from the flow, exposes it to a duration that does not coincide with the instant of perception.</p>

    <p>To critique means to suspend evidence, to defer consensus, to accept that sense is not immediately available.</p>

    <p>Without this suspension, there is no knowledge, only recognition.</p>

    <p>When critique does not operate, objects continue to exist.  
    They appear, circulate, are exchanged, shared.</p>

    <p>But they do not insist.  
    They do not return.  
    They do not accumulate differences.</p>

    <p>Their presence does not become experience, but succession.</p>

    <p>What is missing is not meaning, but the possibility that meaning stabilizes over time.</p>

    <p>In the absence of critique, the world does not become mute: it becomes indifferent.</p>

    <p>When critique is deactivated, it is not only art that loses thickness; it is the entire system of sense production that flattens.</p>

    <p>This absence is not a void.  
    It is a saturation.</p>

    <p>Attention is continuously solicited, but never held.  
    Everything is immediately accessible and therefore immediately substitutable.</p>

    <p>Where everything is available, nothing is necessary.</p>

    <p>Critique, which requires choice, loss, renunciation, thus finds itself deprived of its operational space.</p>

    <p>It is not rejected: it is rendered superfluous.</p>

    <p>The critical gesture implies a form of responsibility that is not moral, but temporal.</p>

    <p>To decide to stop at something means subtracting time from something else.  
    It means accepting a hierarchy, even if provisional.</p>

    <p>In a configuration that privileges continuity and reversibility, this decision appears as an unnecessary risk.</p>

    <p>Thought, to be critical, must be able to fail.  
    It must be able to remain alone.  
    It must be able to be contested.</p>

    <p>When these conditions are no longer sustainable, critique transforms into language without arrest.</p>

    <p>Art is not the first to lose this possibility.  
    Art is only one of the places where the loss becomes visible.</p>

    <p>Precisely because it is not necessary, because it does not produce immediate utility, art renders evident what has already occurred elsewhere: the growing difficulty of exercising attention over time.</p>

    <p>When even art is traversed without dwelling, it is not art that has changed, but the regime of experience.</p>

    <p>Without critique, the work is not denied.  
    It is consumed as event.</p>

    <p>It does not enter a history of thought, but a sequence of appearances.</p>

    <p>Not because it does not signify, but because its signifying is not put to the test.</p>

    <p>Critique does not serve to explain the work, but to render it responsible.</p>

    <p>Responsible for what it opens, for what it closes, for what it leaves suspended.</p>

    <p>Critique does not originate in art.  
    It originates as a human device of discernment in time.</p>

    <p>The loss of critique is therefore not the loss of a profession or a role.  
    It is the loss of a cognitive function.</p>

    <p>It is the growing incapacity to distinguish what merits return from what can be let go.</p>

    <p>In this incapacity, the world becomes simultaneous, but not deep.  
    Extended, but not articulated.</p>

    <p>Today critique is adrift because it has lost its methodological self-legitimation.</p>

    <p>It no longer knows what it can demand, where to stop, when to say “no.”</p>

    <p>In the absence of guidance, the critic becomes functional to the general course.</p>

    <p>Not out of bad faith, but out of the absence of a principle of separation.</p>

    <p>To speak of conditions of an absent practice means recognizing that absence is not accidental.</p>

    <p>It is the coherent outcome of a configuration of attention that privileges movement over duration.</p>

    <p>Critique, in this context, cannot be recovered as a tool.</p>

    <p>It can only be reactivated as a gesture.</p>

    <p>A gesture that promises neither visibility, nor consensus, nor centrality.</p>

    <p>Where someone accepts to stop, to return, to sustain a difference over time, critique reemerges.</p>

    <p>Not as institution, but as possibility.  
    Not as answer, but as a question that insists.</p>

    <p>Not as a guarantee of value, but as the condition by which what appears can still be thought.</p>

    <p><em>Krisis is: to decide, to separate, to hold, to assume consequences.</em></p>
